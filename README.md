scores
======

Musical scores written in ABC notation. [Output folder](output) also
contains HTML, MIDI and PDF files generated from the ABC scores.

Scores are original music, created either by me or by rock band
Primakers. Please, look at copyright notes inside the score for
authoring and licensing information. If no license specified,
CC-BY-NC-SA applies by default to score and generated music.

I used [EasyABC](http://www.nilsliberg.se/ksp/easyabc/) program, which
integrates everything you need, and generates the score as you type.


Score list
----------

* [Love](love.abc): most famous Primakers song. ABC file also includes
  all the lyrics, very useful for fans :). Two voices are written in the
  staff: singer and bass. Guitar chords are also written on top and are
  rendered to MIDI. In the header there is a drum pattern defined that
  also is played in MIDI.

* [Amateur Intro](amateur.abc): original soundtrack of short film
  "Amateur" (2013. Dir: David Rodr√≠guez). Intro is a 2 minute tune that
  is played at the beginning of the film. Music goes synchronized with
  images, that is why there are some text marks in the staff. My most
  complex composition up till now, there are 8 instruments, so I created
  comments as guidelines in order to make the content more readable.


Why ABC?
--------

After playing with some score authoring software, I went to the
basics: text editor and ABC notation, because:

* It's a easy notation to remember, at least most basic elements.
* It's powerful enough to create mid complexity scores.
* Easy to edit: cut, paste, reuse...
* Extraordinary tools for conversion to MIDI, HTML+SVG and PDF.
* Easy versioning with typical VCS tools.
* Good online documentation and examples.

In my soundtrack compositing workflow ABC has become the starting point.
I can go quick enough to make "executable notes" and then refine them
until composition is finished. After that and depending on the instrument,
I either directly use generated MIDI sequence or play the instrument
reading generated PDF.
