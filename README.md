scores
======

Musical scores written in ABC notation.

Origin
------

Scores are original music, created either by me or by rock band Primakers. Please, look at copyright notes inside the score for authoring and licensing information. If no license specified, CC-BY-NC-SA applies by default to score and generated music.

I used [EasyABC](http://www.nilsliberg.se/ksp/easyabc/) program, which integrates everything you need, and generates the score as you type.

Why ABC?
--------

After playing with some score authoring software, I went to the basics: text editor and ABC notation, because:

* It's a easy notation to remember, at least most basic elements.
* It's powerful enough to create mid complexity scores. 
* Easy to edit: cut, paste, reuse...
* Extraordinary tools for conversion to MIDI and PDF.
* Easy versioning with typical VCS tools.
* Good online documentation and examples.
